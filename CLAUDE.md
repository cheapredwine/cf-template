## First session bootstrap

If the Project context section below still says "TODO", this project was just created from the template and has not been configured yet. Before doing anything else:

1. Ask the user: "What does this project do?" — use the answer to replace the Project context section
2. Ask the user: "Which bindings will you need?" — trim the Stack table to only those
3. Uncomment the matching bindings in `wrangler.toml` and update `src/types.ts` `Env` to match
4. Remove the First steps section from `README.md`
5. Tell the user: "Template configured. Ready to build."

Do not proceed with any other work until these steps are done.

## Project context

<!-- TODO: Replace this section with a description of this specific project -->
This is a Cloudflare-native project. All compute runs on Workers. There is no Node.js server, no Docker, no traditional backend. When in doubt, the answer is probably a Worker, a Durable Object, or a binding — not a new service.

---

## Stack

| Concern | Tool |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Cloudflare Workers |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Package manager | bun |
| Testing | vitest |
| Linting / formatting | biome |
| Storage (relational) | D1 |
| Storage (blob) | R2 |
| Storage (ephemeral KV) | Workers KV |
| Stateful coordination | Durable Objects |
| Agent framework | McpAgent (workers-mcp) |
| Local dev | wrangler dev |

<!-- TODO: Remove bindings not used in this project -->

## TypeScript conventions

- `strict: true` in tsconfig. No exceptions.
- No `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow it, or define a proper type.
- No type assertions (`as Foo`) unless you add a comment explaining why it's safe.
- Shared types go in `src/types.ts`. Not inline, not scattered.
- Prefer `type` over `interface` unless declaration merging is needed.
- Prefer explicit return types on exported functions.

---

## Code style

- No classes. Functions and closures only. Durable Objects are the one exception — they require a class by the Workers runtime contract.
- One concern per file. Don't put multiple unrelated handlers or utilities in the same file.
- Explicit error returns over `try/catch` where practical. Prefer `Result<T, E>` pattern for functions that can fail in expected ways.
- No magic strings. Named constants or enums for anything used more than once.
- No commented-out code. Delete it. Git has history.

---

## Comments

- Comment on **why**, never on **what**.
- If a block of code needs a what-comment to be understood, simplify the code instead.
- JSDoc on all exported functions: description, `@param`, `@returns`. Nothing else.
- Inline comments only for non-obvious decisions, tradeoffs, or Cloudflare-specific gotchas.

## File structure

```
src/
  index.ts          # Worker entry point — routing only, no business logic
  types.ts          # All shared types
  handlers/         # One file per route or concern
  lib/              # Pure utility functions with no Worker dependencies
  agents/           # McpAgent definitions
__tests__/          # Mirrors src/ structure
wrangler.toml
biome.json
tsconfig.json
```

Do not create files outside this structure without asking first.

---

## Testing

- Every exported function gets at least one test. No exceptions.
- Tests live in `__tests__/` and mirror the `src/` directory structure.
- Test file naming: `foo.test.ts` mirrors `src/foo.ts`.
- Test behavior, not implementation. If a refactor breaks tests without changing behavior, the tests are wrong.
- No empty tests. No `expect(true).toBe(true)`. No tests that only check a value is defined.
- Cover: happy path, expected failure cases, and edge cases (empty input, nulls, boundary values).
- For Workers: use `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` for tests that need the Workers runtime.
- Mock external services (D1, R2, KV, fetch) — don't hit real resources in tests.

---

## Cloudflare-specific rules

- **Never use Node.js built-ins** (`fs`, `path`, `crypto`, `stream`, etc.). Use Web API equivalents or Workers-native APIs.
- **Workers AI tool calling**: assume JSON-mode is required unless you have confirmed native tool call support on the specific model. Default workaround: prompt the model to return `{"action": "...", ...}` and parse.
- **D1**: always use prepared statements. Never concatenate user input into SQL strings.
- **KV**: not for data that needs consistency. For ephemeral caching and config only.
- **Durable Objects**: one DO per logical entity, not per user session. Think carefully about migration behavior before changing DO class names or storage schemas.
- **Secrets**: use `wrangler secret put` for anything sensitive. Never put secrets in `wrangler.toml` or `.dev.vars` files committed to the repo.
- **`wrangler.toml`**: do not modify without asking. It controls bindings, routes, and compatibility dates — mistakes here break the whole deployment.

---

## Handling uncertainty

**Ask before proceeding on:**
- Architecture decisions (new files, new bindings, new services, data model changes)
- Anything that modifies `wrangler.toml`
- Adding new dependencies
- Deleting or renaming existing files
- Any approach where two reasonable implementations exist and the tradeoff isn't obvious

**Make a reasonable call and note your assumption on:**
- Implementation details within an established pattern
- Naming of internal variables and functions
- Order of operations within a function
- Test case selection

When you make an assumption, note it briefly at the end of your response: `Assumed: X. Let me know if you'd prefer Y.`

---

## What not to do

- Do not add logging unless asked. One `console.log` left in production code silently burns CPU.
- Do not install new dependencies without asking. Check if something in the existing stack already covers the need.
- Do not generate boilerplate "just in case." Build exactly what was asked.
- Do not write placeholder implementations with TODO comments and call it done.
- Do not explain what you just did in a long post-response summary. Show the diff, state any assumptions, stop.

---

## Local dev workflow

```bash
bun install          # install deps
wrangler dev         # local Worker dev server
bun test             # run vitest
bun run lint         # biome check
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

All four should pass before considering anything shippable.

---

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- `wrangler dev` and `wrangler dev --local` behave differently for D1 — always use `--local` for local DB testing.
- McpAgent sessions are tied to Durable Objects — don't expect them to survive a DO migration.
- Workers AI responses are non-deterministic even at temperature 0 on some models — write tests that check structure, not exact content.
- R2 `put` is eventually consistent for list operations — don't rely on immediate list visibility after a write in tests.
